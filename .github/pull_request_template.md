## :white_check_mark: Checklist for your Pull Request

<!--
Ideally a PR has all of the checkmarks set.

If something in this list is irrelevant to your PR, you should still set this
checkmark indicating that you are sure it is dealt with (be that by irrelevance).

If you don't set a checkmark (e. g. don't add a test for new functionality),
you must be able to justify that.

- Tests
  - [ ] If I added new functionality, I added tests covering it.
  - [ ] If I fixed a bug, I added a regression test to prevent the bug from
        silently reappearing again.

- Documentation
  - [ ] I checked whether I should update the docs and did so if necessary:
    - [README](../tree/master/README.md)
