# Edna analysis

This folder contains implementation of Edna data analysis in Python.

## Usage

First of all, normally you don't want to call this code directly, it is supposed to be called from `edna-server`.
We use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, though you can install dependencies using your favorite way and not use `poetry`.
To get shell with all dependencies installed run `poetry install` and then `poetry shell` from this directory.
